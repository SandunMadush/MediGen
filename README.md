## Commit Guidelines

### Format of the commit message

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

#### Allowed `<type>`

- feat (feature)
- fix (bug fix)
- docs (documentation)
- style (formatting, missing semi colons, …)
- refactor
- test (when adding missing tests)
- chore (maintain)

#### Allowed `<scope>`

Scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example $location, $browser, $compile, $rootScope, ngHref, ngClick, ngView, etc...

#### `<subject>` text

- use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end
